\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my advisor Troels Bjerre Lund for guidance and suggestions. I would also like to thank fellow students Alexander Mønnike Hansen, Frank Andersen, Mathias Oliver Valdbjørn Jørgensen, and Mikkel Hooge Sørensen, for great discussions and ideas. The people at DeepMind for novel approaches to game AIs and excellent papers describing procedures and results. Furthermore, I would like to thank Vadim V. Anshelevich for granting permission to use his Hex AI Hexy for validation of my trained models. Software acknowledgements:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Python} - a versatile programming language that allows for fast prototyping and for me is just a pleasure to work in.
  \item \textbf{PyTorch} - an excellent deep learning framework, that is easy to set up, easy to understand, yet very powerful, very customizable, and very fast.
  \item \textbf{Nvidia CUDA} - again another deep learning enabling software, coupled to the bread and butter deep learning hardware, the GPU. Not because I have directly programmed with the CUDA toolkit, but it has been doing tremendous work behind the scenes in PyTorch.
  \item \textbf{Numpy} - a Python package with many useful numerical and statistical functions, as well as matrix representation of data.
  \item \textbf{Numba} - it felt like it was sent from above, when I discovered numba, a compiler that translates Python code into very fast machine code.
\end{itemize}
